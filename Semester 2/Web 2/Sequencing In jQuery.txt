Sequencing in jQuery

1. Using delay(milliseconds) method. Do use this in this assignment in a very specific place!

2. Complete/callback function as a parameter in a jQuery method

Eg animate({properties}, duration, easing, function() {
	// code in here will only execute when the animate() completes
   });

3. Chaining animate() methods together on the same jQuery object

eg $(selector).animate().animate();

The second (chained) animate() would only begin to run once the first animate has completed.

4. Using a jQuery promise.
