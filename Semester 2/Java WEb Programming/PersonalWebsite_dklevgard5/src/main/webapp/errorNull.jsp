<h1>Null Pointer</h1>
 <p>A null pointer occurs when the compiler is expecting an object to exist but the object in fact does not exist. For example,
  if you were to do stringVariable.equals(), the compiler would expect there to be a string object in the variable "stringVariable"
 If there is no object stored in that variable, the compiler will throw a nell pointer exception. Null pointer exceptions generally
 only occur when you attempt to access a property or a method (function) that belongs to an object.</p>
