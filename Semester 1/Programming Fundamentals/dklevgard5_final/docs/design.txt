Solution Algorithm
 	bettingOnDice
          initialize money to 1000000
          initialize bet
          initialize lost to money minus bet
          initialize won to money plus bet times 2
          initialize dice
          
          WHILE bet does not equal "cash out" or money > 0 
            prompt for amount of bet
            check for errors in amount of bet
            roll the dice
            IF dice equals 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
              display dice was + dice roll + you lost
              display lost
              money equals lost
            ELSE IF dice equals 5, 9, 11
              display dice roll and draw
              display "Money was returned"
            ELSE IF dice equals 7
