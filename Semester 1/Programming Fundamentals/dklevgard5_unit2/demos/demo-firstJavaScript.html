   It's good to have lots of lines like this that
   explain our code. For example the next line of code
   uses a &quot;break&quot; character, which is common in many
   programming languages.

   However, be very careful not to comment things that are obvious.
   Instead, comment  &quot;why&quot;, not what.

// This means that we don't want it to run but we don't
// want to delete it.
