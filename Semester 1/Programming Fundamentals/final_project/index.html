        <h3>Game's Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Write a program that asks for the amount to bet. This will loop as long as
          the user wishes to bet. Have them type "cash out" to stop betting. The amount of 
          money a user has will appear with the prompt for the bet. A random dice roll will
          determine what happens with the amount betted. When the user is done, 
          or the money drops to zero, there will be an output of what the user betted and 
          how they did.</p>
          
          <p>Nouns:</p>
          <p>amount, money, prompt, dice roll, output</p>
          <p>Verbs:</p>
          <p> asks, stop, appear, determine</p>
